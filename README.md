# boilerplates

Life is too short to start new projects from scratch. This repo is a collection of boilerplates for the technologies I use the most.

Each boilerplate will be in a different branch. use them at **your own risk**.

## Branches:

- `react` : Building SPA never been this amazing.
- `Next14` : Ride the hype with React Server Components (WIP).
- `quick-node` : Get something started quick for testing.

## Usage with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

`degit` is a tool that facilitate downloading code fron github.

Create a new sub-directory for the boilerplate:

```sh
npx degit jihedmastouri/bp#<branch-name> <dir-name>
```

Or Leave `<dir-name>` empty to download to the same directory.
